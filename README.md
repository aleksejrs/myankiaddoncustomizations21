These are the non-private customized files of the Anki 2 add-ons I use with Anki 2.1.22.

Some of them may not work without the private files, but the functions there are not always essential to these add-ons, so you can replace the calls with simpler ones.

These are files for **old** versions of these addons:
* [MorphMan](https://github.com/kaegi/MorphMan): uses not just single words, but also pairs of words. That makes it require tens of gigabytes of RAM.
* [Cardistry](https://github.com/lovac42/Cardistry): takes card difficulty into account.
* [Advanced Browser](https://github.com/AnKing-VIP/advanced-browser) + Cardistry: shows a forecast.
* [autoEaseFactor](https://github.com/brownbat/autoEaseFactor): the private file uses tags to choose target retention.
