These are the non-private customized files of the Anki 2 add-ons I use with Anki 2.1.22.

Some of them may not work without the private files, but the functions there are not always essential to these add-ons, so you can replace the calls with simpler ones.

* MorphMan: uses not just single words, but also pairs of words. That makes it require tens of gigabytes of RAM.
* Cardistry: takes card difficulty into account.
* Advanced Browser + Cardistry: shows a forecast.
